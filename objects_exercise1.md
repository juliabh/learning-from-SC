Object: complex number

Create a class to represent complex numbers

Real component
Imaginary component

Represent both as doubles (or floats)

Would like to be able to return the magnitude of the complex number:
- make a public function to return the magnitude, which will be of type double

To help calculate the magnitude, would like to have a function called square
- which will be a private static function

On the complex number object, would like 3 static methods:
- plus, which takes in 2 complex numbers and delivers a third
- multiply, which takes in 2 complex numbers and delivers a third
- minus
